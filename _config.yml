# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Oregon, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Thien Huu Nguyen](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~thien/). My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) with an emphasis on Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource languages and efficient LLMs.


  Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/) from September 2018 to May 2023, graduating with an Excellent Degree and a GPA of 3.71/4.0. During my undergraduate studies, I was under the supervision of [Dr. Linh Ngo Van](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/).


  Currently, I am exploring Efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning Systems (MLSys) to enhance training optimization and develop scalable architectures for improved performance and resource management.
